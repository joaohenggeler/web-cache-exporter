This document lists any third-party code used by the Web Cache Exporter.
Each third-party library is contained in a subdirectory next to this
text file. This file documents why a library was used, who made it,
where it can be found, and any modifications that were made to it.

To make compiling this program easier, we bundle the necessary third-party
code with our own source files, provided we are allowed to distribute it.
Each library's license is also included in its respective subdirectory.

This tool uses this library to decompress files using the Gzip, Zlib,
and raw DEFLATE formats. For example, decompressing cached files according
to the Content-Encoding value in their HTTP headers.

"Brotli" by Google
======================================================================

This tool uses this library to decompress files using the Brotli format.
For example, decompressing cached files according to the Content-Encoding
value in their HTTP headers.

======================================================================
Microsoft's Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) API
======================================================================

This tool uses the ESE API to export later versions of the WinINet cache.
As such, the header file "esent.h" is required to build this application.

For later versions of Visual Studio, this file is already part of the
Windows SDK.

For Visual Studio 2005, this file must be obtained from somewhere else
and added to the subdirectory "ESENT" before building.

For this project, this header file was taken from the Windows Vista SDK
and is not included in this repository.
