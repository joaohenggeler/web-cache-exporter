This document lists any third party code used by the Web Cache Exporter.
Each third party library is contained in a subdirectory next to this
text file. This file will document why a library was used, who made it,
where it can be found, and any modifications.

To make compiling this program easier, we will bundle the third party
library's code with our own source files, provided we are allowed to
distribute it. Each library's license will also be included in its
respective subdirectory.

"Portable C++ Hashing Library" by Stephan Brumme
======================================================================

This tool uses this hashing library to generate the SHA-256 value for
each exported file.

The "SHA-256" subdirectory includes two source files: "sha256.h" and
"sha256_modified.cpp". This last file was modified to disable any
warnings that would prevent this tool from compiling. This was done
by adding a single "#pragma warning(...)" to the top of the source file.

Microsoft's Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) API
======================================================================

This tool uses the ESE API to export later versions of the WinINet cache.
As such, the header file "esent.h" is required to build this application.

For later versions of Visual Studio, this file is already part of the
Windows SDK.

For Visual Studio 2005, this file must be obtained from somewhere else
and added to the subdirectory "ESENT" before building.

For this project, this header file was taken from the Windows Vista SDK
and is not included in this repository.
