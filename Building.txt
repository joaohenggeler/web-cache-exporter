The Web Cache Exporter is written in C-style C++03 and may be compiled
using the Build.bat batch file. See the comments at the top of this
file to learn how to use and set each basic build parameter. The batch
file is executed using the following syntax:

> Build.bat [Optional Compiler Arguments]

For example:
> Build.bat
> Build.bat /D EXPORT_EMPTY_FILES

Note that this project does not use semantic versioning.

======================================================================

In order to target Windows 98 and ME, this program is compiled using
Visual Studio 2005. It's possible to skip building this target and
use Visual Studio 2015 or later by changing the following batch
variables:

* Setting VCVARSALL_PATH to the path of the vcvarsall.bat batch file
that is installed with Visual Studio.
* Setting USE_VS_2005_OPTIONS to "No".

Note that this application hasn't been thoroughly tested with modern
versions of Visual Studio.

======================================================================

This batch file can also use the 7-Zip utility to package any releases.
By default, the Build.bat will try to run the 7-Zip executable located
in the path specified by the _7ZIP_EXE_PATH variable. This utility is
not included with the source distribution. If you don't care about
packaging the compiled application, you may disable this feature by
setting the PACKAGE_BUILD variable to "No".

======================================================================

To make compiling this program easier, we bundle the necessary third-party
code with our own source files, provided we are allowed to distribute it.
See the dependencies list located in "Source/ThirdParty/Dependencies.txt"
to learn more about any third-party libraries used by this application.
