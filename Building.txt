The Web Cache Exporter is written in C-style C++03 and may be compiled
using the Build.bat batch file. See the comments at the top of this
file to learn how to use and set each basic build parameter. The batch
file is executed using the following syntax:

> Build.bat <Mandatory Build Mode> [Optional Compiler Arguments]

For example:
> Build.bat release
> Build.bat release /Zi
> Build.bat debug
> Build.bat debug /D WCE_EMPTY_EXPORT

You can also build and run the project using Visual Studio Code provided
the batch file points to a valid Visual Studio installation.

Note that this project does not use semantic versioning.

======================================================================

In order to target Windows 98 and ME, this program is compiled using
Visual Studio 2005. It's possible to skip building this target and
use Visual Studio 2015 or later by changing the following batch
variables:

* Setting VCVARSALL_PATH to the path of the vcvarsall.bat batch file
that is installed with Visual Studio.

* Setting USE_VS_2005_OPTIONS to "No".

Note that this application hasn't been thoroughly tested with modern
versions of Visual Studio.

======================================================================

This batch file can also use the 7-Zip utility to package any releases.
By default, the Build.bat will try to run the 7-Zip executable located
in the path specified by the _7ZIP_EXE_PATH variable. This utility is
not included with the source distribution. If you don't care about
packaging the compiled application, you may disable this feature by
setting the PACKAGE_BUILD variable to "No".

7-Zip Command Line Version 9.20 (7za9209) is used to package the official
releases. This version was chosen since it's the last one that's compatible
with Windows 9x.

The batch will also use the SFX module "7z.sfx" to create a self-extracting
archive. If you're using the standalone version (7za9209), you'll have to
copy that file from the main 7-Zip 9.20 install (7z920.exe) and place it
next to the standalone 7-Zip executable.

To make compiling this program easier, we bundle the necessary third-party
code with our own source files, provided we are allowed to distribute it.
See the dependencies list located in "Source/ThirdParty/Dependencies.txt"
to learn more about any third-party libraries used by this application.
