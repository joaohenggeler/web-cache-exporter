This directory contains any useful scripts that can be used to interface
with the Web Cache Exporter or to process its output. See the comments
at the top of each file for more details.

* SearchForLostWebMedia.bat: a batch file that runs the application with
a specific set of command line options that tell it to search for potentially
lost web media (games, animations, virtual worlds, etc).

* tally_groups.py: a Python 3 script that counts the number of different
file and URL groups in the CSV files generated by the application.
