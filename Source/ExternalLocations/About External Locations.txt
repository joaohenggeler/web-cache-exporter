External locations files are text files that define zero or more profiles,
each one specifying a list of absolute paths of key Windows locations. This
allows you to export the cache from files that came from another computer.
This includes any Windows version from 98 to 10.

The following section will show you how to define profiles. Lines that start
with a semicolon ";" are treated as comments and are not processed. External
locations files must always end in a newline. You can only use spaces and tabs
as whitespace.

; This defines the beginning of a profile with the name "Username".
; Each profile ends when it reaches the "END" keyword. 
BEGIN_PROFILE Username

	; This list represents a possible user profile in a Windows XP machine.
	; Each different type of location is mapped to an absolute path on the
	; current computer that's running the Web Cache Exporter.
	;
	; All of these locations must be specified. Otherwise, the profile will
	; be skipped.

	WINDOWS				C:\My Old Drives\Windows XP\WINDOWS
	TEMPORARY			C:\My Old Drives\Windows XP\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temp
	USER_PROFILE		C:\My Old Drives\Windows XP\Documents and Settings\Username

	APPDATA				C:\My Old Drives\Windows XP\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data
	LOCAL_APPDATA		C:\My Old Drives\Windows XP\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Application Data
	LOCAL_LOW_APPDATA	<None>

	INTERNET_CACHE		C:\My Old Drives\Windows XP\Documents and Settings\Username\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files

END

To export the cache from every user profile, we'd need to define multiple
lists and change any necessary paths. For the same Windows version, this
usually just means changing the username.

Notice how the LOCAL_LOW_APPDATA location uses the "<None>" keyword. This
tells the application to assume that this path is empty, and is used when
the Windows version of the computer where the files originated didn't have
this type of location.

The Web Cache Exporter will create multiple subfolders in the main output
folder with each profile's name. Because of this, you shouldn't use any
reserved Windows folder name characters.

External locations files use UTF-8 as their character encoding, meaning you
can use any Unicode character in the various paths. In the Windows 98 and ME
builds, you must only use ASCII characters. However, since this feature is
meant to export the cache from an older computer's files in a modern machine,
this situation is extremely unlikely to come up.

Below is a reference of where these default locations are found in every
supported Windows version:
