Groups files are text files that define zero or more groups, each one
specifying a list of attributes to match to files found on a web browser
or plugin's cache. There are two types of groups:

- File groups, which act on a file's properties (file signature, MIME
type, and file extension). These are used to label files according to
their file format. For example, files that are used by the Flash Player.

- URL groups, which act on a cached file's URL. These are used to label
files according to their original location on the internet. For example,
files that were hosted on a web portal like Newgrounds.com.

Groups files must always end in a .group extension. The Web Cache Exporter
only loads groups from files with this extension located in this directory.
This about file, for example, isn't loaded. Group files are loaded in
alphabetical order. In each file, groups are loaded from top to bottom.

The following section will show you how to define each type of group. Lines
that start with a semicolon ";" are treated as comments and are not processed.
Groups files must always end in a newline. You can only use spaces and tabs
as whitespace.

; This defines the beginning of a file group with the name "HTML".
; Each group or list of attributes ends when it reaches the "END" keyword. 
BEGIN_FILE_GROUP HTML

	; This defines a list of file signatures. These are composed of one
	or more bytes represented in hexadecimal. Each value ranges from 00
	to FF. Only one file signature is allowed per line.

	; You can also use "__" as wildcards that match any byte.

	BEGIN_FILE_SIGNATURES
		; This represents the following characters: "<html".
		3C 68 74 6D 6C

		; This represents the following characters: "<HTML".
		3C 48 54 4D 4C

		; This represents "<HT" followed by any other two bytes.
		3C 48 54 __ __
	END

	; This defines a list of MIME types. You can add multiple values in
	each line.

	BEGIN_MIME_TYPES
		text/html
		application/xhtml
	END

	; This defines a list of file extensions. You can add multiple values
	in each line.

	BEGIN_FILE_EXTENSIONS
		htm html
		xhtml
	END

END

Although these three types of lists may appear in any order and more than
once, you should specify each type once and in this order: file signatures
before MIME types before file extensions. This order matches the precedence
that the Web Cache Exporter uses, making the group files easier to read.
For example, if a cached file matches a file signature in a group, it
won't bother checking the remaining MIME types and file extensions.

Matching Rules:

0. All comparisons are case insensitive.

1. File signatures are matched exactly, taking into account any wildcard
bytes. If the file's size is smaller than the file signature, it will never
match it.

2. MIME types match the beginning of the text. For example, a group that specifies
"text/java" will match "text/javascript" and "text/javascript; charset=UTF-8".

3. File extensions are matched exactly. For example, a group that specifies
"htm" will match .htm files, but not .html.

URL groups are very similar:

; This defines the beginning of a URL group with the name "Cartoon Network".
BEGIN_URL_GROUP Cartoon Network

	; This defines a list of domains. You can use the forward slash "/"
	character to separate the host segment from the path. Only one domain
	is allowed per line.

	; You can also add ".*" to the end of a host to match any top or second
	; level domain.

	BEGIN_DOMAINS
		; This defines the host "cartoonnetwork.com" and no path.
		cartoonnetwork.com

		; This defines the host "turner.com" and the path "toon".
		turner.com/toon

		; This defines the host "cartoonnetwork" with any top or second
		; level domain and no path.
		cartoonnetwork.*

		; This defines the host "turner" with any top or second level
		; domain and the path "toon".
		turner.*/toon
	END

END

Matching Rules:

0. All comparisons are case insensitive.

1. The host segments match the ending of a URL's host. For example, a group
that specifies "example.com" will match the following:
- "http://www.example.com/index.html"
- "mms://cdn.example.com:80/path/video.mp4",
- "https://download.example.com/path/updates/file.php?version=123&platform=ABC#top"

This check allows you to match multiple subdomains.

2. If the path exists, it must also match the beginning of a URL's path.
Using the same example, a group that specifies "example.com/path" will
match the last two URLs. If it instead specifies "example.com/path/updates",
it will only match the last one.

3. If the host segment ends with ".*", it will match the ending of a URL's
host that contains any top or second level domain. For example, a group that
specifies "example.*" will match the following:
- "http://www.example.com/index.html"
- "http://cdn.example.net/index.html"
- "http://download.example.co.uk/index.html"

Groups files use UTF-8 as their character encoding, meaning you can use
any Unicode character in the various lists. In the Windows 98 and ME builds
these values are converted into ANSI strings, meaning only a subset of Unicode
characters may be used. Because of this, any offical group files that are
bundled with this tool will always use ASCII characters to maintain compatibility
with every Windows version. If you're making your own group files, and are
only running this application on Windows 2000 or later, you can use any Unicode
characters.
